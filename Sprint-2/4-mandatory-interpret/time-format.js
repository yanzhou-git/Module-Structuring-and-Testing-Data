// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here: 3 times

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here: 0

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here: "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here: 61/60

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here: "01"
