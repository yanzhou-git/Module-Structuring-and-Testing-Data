/* 
Password Validation

Write a program that should check if a password is valid
and returns a boolean

To be valid, a password must:
- Have at least 5 characters.
- Have at least one English uppercase letter (A-Z)
- Have at least one English lowercase letter (a-z)
- Have at least one number (0-9)
- Have at least one of the following non-alphanumeric symbols: ("!", "#", "$", "%", ".", "*", "&")
- Must not be any previous password in the passwords array. 

You must breakdown this problem in order to solve it. Find one test case first and get that working


const isValidPassword = require("./password-validator.js");
test("password has at least 5 characters", () => {
    // Arrange
    const password = "12345";
    // Act
    const result = isValidPassword(password);
    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(true);
}
);
*/

const versatilPassword = require("./password-validator.js");
test("password fulfill all requirement", () => {
    // Arrange
    const password = "12Ab**";
    // Act
    const result = versatilPassword(password);
    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(true);
}
);
